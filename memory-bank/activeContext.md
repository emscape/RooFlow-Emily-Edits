## Active Entries

<!-- @active -->
[2025-03-26 14:19:00] - Initialized Memory Bank Optimization System
<!-- @end -->

<!-- @completed -->
[2025-03-26 16:32:00] - Created test project for Memory Bank Optimization System
<!-- @end -->


[2025-03-29 18:47:07] - Fixed parameter set ambiguity in `memory-manager.ps1` by explicitly assigning `$Command` and `$MemoryBankPath` to all parameter sets (ArchiveProject, SetProjectStatus, RetrieveArchive, OptimizeBank).



<!-- @active -->
[2025-03-30 21:41:00] - Ran `Apply-RooMemorySystemToExisting.ps1` which created `mcp-config.json` in the project root. Moved `mcp-config.json` to the expected `.roo/` directory to align with `McpHandler.psm1`. Noted discrepancy: setup script should create the file in `.roo/` directly. MCP configuration file is now present but servers are disabled by default.
