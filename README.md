- Enhanced functionality for applying RooFlow to existing projects and new projects with PowerShell scripts

## 🎯 Overview

RooFlow enhances AI-assisted development in VS Code by providing **persistent project context** and **optimized mode interactions**, resulting in **reduced token consumption** and a more efficient workflow.  It builds upon the concepts of the Roo Code Memory Bank, but streamlines the process and introduces a more integrated system of modes. RooFlow ensures your AI assistant maintains a deep understanding of your project across sessions, even after interruptions.

### Key Improvements over Roo Code Memory Bank:

*   **Reduced Token Consumption:** Optimized prompts and instructions minimize token usage.
*   **Five Integrated Modes:**  Architect, Code, Test, Debug, and Ask modes work together seamlessly.
*   **Simplified Setup:**  Easier installation and configuration.
*   **Streamlined Real-time Updates:**  More efficient and targeted Memory Bank updates.
*   **Clearer Instructions:**  Improved YAML-based rule files for better readability and maintainability.

    ├── .rooignore               
    ├── .roomodes
    └──insert-variables.[sh/cmd]
```
   4. **Run insert-variables script**

   #### For Windows: 
   1. Open Command Prompt or PowerShell
   2. Navigate to your project:
      ```cmd
      cd path\to\your\project
      ```
   3. Run the script:

      From Command Prompt:

      ```cmd
      insert-variables.cmd
      ```

      From Powershell:

      ```powershell
      .\insert-variables.cmd
      ```
      Troubleshooting (Windows)
   * **If you get "access denied" or execution policy errors:**
   1. Open PowerShell as Administrator
   2. Run this command once:
      ```powershell
      Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
      ```
   3. Close Administrator PowerShell
   4. Try running the script again from your project directory
   * **If you see "Error: .roo directory not found", verify your directory structure.**
   * **If using PowerShell 7+, run as:**
      ```powershell
      cmd /c insert-variables.cmd
      ```
   #### For Unix/Linux/macOS
   1. Open Terminal
   2. Navigate to your project:
      ```bash
      cd path/to/your/project
      ```
   3. Make the script executable:
      ```bash
      sudo chmod +x insert-variables.sh
      ```
   4. Run the script:
      ```bash
      ./insert-variables.sh
      ```

      Troubleshooting (Unix/Linux/macOS)
   * **If you see "Permission denied", run:** 
      ```bash
      sudo chmod +x insert-variables.sh
      ```
   * **If you see "Error: .roo directory not found", verify your directory structure**

    
   #### Expected Output
   The script will:
   1. Detect your system configuration
   2. Process each system prompt file
   3. Show "Processing" and "Completed" messages for each file
   4. Display "Done" when finished


   #### Variables Being Replaced
   The script replaces these placeholders with your system-specific values:
   - OS_PLACEHOLDER (e.g., "Windows 10 Pro" or "Ubuntu 22.04")
   - SHELL_PLACEHOLDER (e.g., "cmd" or "bash")
   - HOME_PLACEHOLDER (your home directory)
   - WORKSPACE_PLACEHOLDER (your project directory)
   - GLOBAL_SETTINGS_PLACEHOLDER (Roo Code global settings path)
   - MCP_LOCATION_PLACEHOLDER (Roo Code MCP directory path)
   - MCP_SETTINGS_PLACEHOLDER (Roo Code MCP settings path)

   #### Next Steps
   After running the script:
   1. Verify that `.roo/system-prompt-*` files contain your system paths
   2. Start using VS Code with the Roo Code extension
   3. The Memory Bank will be initialized on first use

   ### 2. Using RooFlow

   1.  **Start a Chat:** Open a new Roo Code chat in your project.
   2.  **Select a Mode:** Choose the appropriate mode (Architect, Code, Test, Debug, Ask) for your task.
   3.  **Interact with Roo:**  Give Roo instructions and ask questions. Roo will automatically use the Memory Bank to maintain context.
   4.  **Memory Bank Initialization:**  If you start a chat in a project *without* a `memory-bank/` directory, Roo will suggest switching to Architect mode and guide you through the initialization process.
   5. **"Update Memory Bank" Command:** At any time, you can type "Update Memory Bank" or "UMB" to force a synchronization of the chat session's information into the Memory Bank. This is useful for ensuring continuity across sessions or before switching modes.

## 📚 Memory Bank Structure

The Memory Bank is a directory named `memory-bank` located in your project's root. It contains several Markdown files that store different aspects of your project's knowledge:

| File                 | Purpose                                                                                                                               |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `activeContext.md`   | Tracks the current session's context: recent changes, current goals, and open questions/issues.                                       |
| `decisionLog.md`     | Records architectural and implementation decisions, including the context, decision, rationale, and implementation details.        |
| `productContext.md`  | Provides a high-level overview of the project, including its goals, features, and overall architecture.                             |
| `progress.md`        | Tracks the progress of the project, including completed work, current tasks, and next steps.  Uses a task list format.               |
| `systemPatterns.md` | (Optional) Documents recurring patterns and standards used in the project (coding patterns, architectural patterns, testing patterns). |

RooFlow automatically manages these files. You generally don't need to edit them directly, although you can review them to understand the AI's knowledge.

## 🛠️ Automation Scripts

To make it easier to apply RooFlow to your projects, we've created PowerShell scripts that automate the setup process:

- [**apply-to-existing-project.ps1**](scripts/apply-to-existing-project.ps1): Applies RooFlow custom modes to an existing project
- [**setup-new-project.ps1**](scripts/setup-new-project.ps1): Creates a new project with RooFlow custom modes

See the [scripts documentation](scripts/README.md) for detailed usage instructions.

## 📖 Documentation
