## 🦝 What This Was

This repository began as a fork of [GreatScottyMac's RooFlow](https://github.com/GreatScottyMac/RooFlow), a system for persistent project context and AI-assisted workflows inside VS Code. I used this space to:

- Extend RooFlow with custom instructions and mode behaviors
- Build out PowerShell-based setup automations
- Explore persistent memory structures and real-time context switching

It was a fascinating ride.

## ❌ Why It’s Archived

While RooFlow has some seriously cool ideas, I’ve since shifted to more lightweight, modular approaches to automation. Maintaining this fork no longer makes sense as my tooling evolves.

Rather than keep an outdated or partially functional repo online, I’m retiring it with gratitude and a clear message for future explorers:

- There are **better ways to organize agentic behavior**
- There are **cleaner ways to manage persistent context**
- And there’s nothing wrong with building something, learning a ton, and moving on.

## 💡 What I Learned

- The limits of prompt-based persistence
- The quirks of YAML-driven system prompts
- How deep AI tooling can get real fast—and why structure matters

And yes, how to surgically extract an embedded AI raccoon from my entire GitHub history.

If you're building your own agent framework, it’s still worth a look. Just bring gloves.
