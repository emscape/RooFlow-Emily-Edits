# Fork Notice

This repository is a fork of [GreatScottyMac's RooFlow](https://github.com/GreatScottyMac/RooFlow) with personal modifications made by Emily. No upstream changes are intended. Please refer to the original repository for the canonical version.

## Emily's Modifications

The following modifications have been made to the original RooFlow project:

- Added custom instructions for language preference (English)
- Added global instructions for interaction style:
  - Ask clarifying questions one at a time
  - Perform one step at a time
  - Prompt for manual actions
  - Use PowerShell syntax for terminal commands
  - Prompt to start a new task when API token cost nears $0.5
- Added mode-specific instructions for the architect mode
- Enhanced functionality for applying RooFlow to existing projects and new projects with PowerShell scripts

## üéØ Overview

RooFlow enhances AI-assisted development in VS Code by providing **persistent project context** and **optimized mode interactions**, resulting in **reduced token consumption** and a more efficient workflow.  It builds upon the concepts of the Roo Code Memory Bank, but streamlines the process and introduces a more integrated system of modes. RooFlow ensures your AI assistant maintains a deep understanding of your project across sessions, even after interruptions.

### Key Improvements over Roo Code Memory Bank:

*   **Reduced Token Consumption:** Optimized prompts and instructions minimize token usage.
*   **Five Integrated Modes:**  Architect, Code, Test, Debug, and Ask modes work together seamlessly.
*   **Simplified Setup:**  Easier installation and configuration.
*   **Streamlined Real-time Updates:**  More efficient and targeted Memory Bank updates.
*   **Clearer Instructions:**  Improved YAML-based rule files for better readability and maintainability.

## üöÄ Quick Start

   ###  1. Installation

   1.  **Install Roo Code Extension:** Ensure you have the [Roo Code extension](https://github.com/RooVetGit/Roo-Code) installed in VS Code.
   2.  **Prerequisite: Install Git:** The installation script requires `git` to be installed and accessible in your system's PATH. Download Git from [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
   3.  **Run the RooFlow Installer Script:**

       This script will clone the necessary configuration files from the RooFlow repository, place them in your current project directory, and run a setup script to inject your system-specific paths into the configuration files. It also copies the `.clinerules-default` file needed for the optional Default mode setup below.

       #### For Windows:

       1.  Download the Windows installer script: [`install_rooflow.cmd`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GreatScottyMac/RooFlow/main/config/install_rooflow.cmd)
           *(Right-click the link -> Save Link As...)*
       2.  Save the `install_rooflow.cmd` file to the **root directory** of your project.
       3.  Open Command Prompt (`cmd.exe`).
       4.  Navigate to your project's root directory:
           ```cmd
           cd path\to\your\project
           ```
       5.  Run the installer script:
           ```cmd
           .\install_rooflow.cmd
           ```
       6.  The script will check for `git`, clone the repository, copy files using a temporary directory, clean up, and run `insert-variables.cmd`. Follow any on-screen prompts or error messages.
       7.  **Note:** Upon successful completion, `install_rooflow.cmd` and `insert-variables.cmd` will be automatically removed.

       #### For Linux/macOS:

       1.  Download the Linux/macOS installer script: [`install_rooflow.sh`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GreatScottyMac/RooFlow/main/config/install_rooflow.sh)
           *(You can use `curl` or `wget` in the terminal, or right-click the link -> Save Link As...)*
           ```bash
           # Example using curl:
           curl -Lo install_rooflow.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GreatScottyMac/RooFlow/main/config/install_rooflow.sh
           ```
       2.  Save/move the `install_rooflow.sh` file to the **root directory** of your project.
       3.  Open your Terminal.
       4.  Navigate to your project's root directory:
           ```bash
           cd path/to/your/project
           ```
       5.  Make the script executable:
           ```bash
           sudo chmod +x install_rooflow.sh
           ```
       6.  Run the installer script:
           ```bash
           ./install_rooflow.sh
           ```
       7.  The script will check for `git`, clone the repository, move files, clean up, and run `insert-variables.sh`. Follow any on-screen prompts or error messages.
       8.  **Note:** Upon successful completion, `install_rooflow.sh` and `insert-variables.sh` will be automatically removed.

   4.  **Verify Installation:** After the script runs successfully:
       *   Check that the `.roo/` directory, `.roomodes` file, and `.clinerules-default` file exist in your project root.
       *   Optionally, inspect the `.roo/system-prompt-*` files to ensure placeholders like `WORKSPACE_PLACEHOLDER` have been replaced with your actual system paths.

   ### Optional: Install Global Default Mode

   The installer script places the necessary rule file (`.clinerules-default`) in your project root. To make the "Default" mode available globally in Roo Code, follow these manual steps using the Roo Code UI:

   1.  **Open Roo Code Settings:** Click the Roo Code icon in the VS Code Activity Bar, then click the "Prompts" icon (looks like a book/document - Step 1 in image below).
    <br> 
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GreatScottyMac/RooFlow/main/config/default-mode/prompt-settings.png" alt="Prompt Settings Icon" width="200"/>

   2.  **Add New Mode:** Scroll down to the "Modes" section and click the "+" icon (Step 

   3.  **Enter Name:** In the "Create New Mode" view, enter `Default` in the "Name" field (Step 3).

   4.  **Slug:** The "Slug" field should automatically populate with `default` (Step 4).

   5.  **Save Location:** Select "Global" (Step 5).

   6.  **Role Definition:** Copy the text below and paste it into the "Role Definition" text box (Step 6).

 ```text      
A custom, global mode in Roo Code, using the Roo Code default rules and instructions, along with the custom instruction set for memory bank functionality. Typically called upon when a functionality is not working correctly with the other custom modes. You should have a very broad range of knowledge and abilities.
```

* Note: The installer script copies a file named `.clinerules-default` to your project root  which contains this same information if you prefer to copy from there.     

<br>

   8.  **Create Mode:** Click the "Create Mode" button (Step 8).

#### The Default mode should now be available for selection in the Roo Code chat interface across all your workspaces.

<br>

   ### 2. Using RooFlow

   1.  **Start a Chat:** Open a new Roo Code chat in your project.
   2.  **Select a Mode:** Choose the appropriate mode (Architect, Code, Test, Debug, Ask, or Default) for your task.
   3.  **Interact with Roo:**  Give Roo instructions and ask questions. Roo will automatically use the Memory Bank to maintain context.
   4.  **Memory Bank Initialization:**  If you start a chat in a project *without* a `memory-bank/` directory, Roo will suggest switching to Architect mode and guide you through the initialization process.
   5. **"Update Memory Bank" Command:** At any time, you can type "Update Memory Bank" or "UMB" to force a synchronization of the chat session's information into the Memory Bank. This is useful for ensuring continuity across sessions or before switching modes.

## üìö Memory Bank Structure

The Memory Bank is a directory named `memory-bank` located in your project's root. It contains several Markdown files that store different aspects of your project's knowledge:

| File                 | Purpose                                                                                                                               |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `activeContext.md`   | Tracks the current session's context: recent changes, current goals, and open questions/issues.                                       |
| `decisionLog.md`     | Records architectural and implementation decisions, including the context, decision, rationale, and implementation details.        |
| `productContext.md`  | Provides a high-level overview of the project, including its goals, features, and overall architecture.                             |
| `progress.md`        | Tracks the progress of the project, including completed work, current tasks, and next steps.  Uses a task list format.               |
| `systemPatterns.md` | (Optional) Documents recurring patterns and standards used in the project (coding patterns, architectural patterns, testing patterns). |

RooFlow automatically manages these files. You generally don't need to edit them directly, although you can review them to understand the AI's knowledge.

## üõ†Ô∏è Automation Scripts

To make it easier to apply RooFlow to your projects, we've created PowerShell scripts that automate the setup process:

- [**apply-to-existing-project.ps1**](scripts/apply-to-existing-project.ps1): Applies RooFlow custom modes to an existing project
- [**setup-new-project.ps1**](scripts/setup-new-project.ps1): Creates a new project with RooFlow custom modes

See the [scripts documentation](scripts/README.md) for detailed usage instructions.

## ‚ú® Features

### üß† Persistent Context

RooFlow remembers project details across sessions, maintaining a consistent understanding of your codebase, design decisions, and progress.

### ‚ö° Real-time Updates

The Memory Bank is updated automatically based on significant events within each mode, ensuring that the context is always up-to-date.

### ü§ù Mode Collaboration

The five modes (Architect, Code, Test, Debug, Ask) are designed to work together seamlessly.  They can switch between each other as needed, and they share information through the Memory Bank.

### ‚¨áÔ∏è Reduced Token Consumption

RooFlow is designed to use fewer tokens than previous systems, making it more efficient and cost-effective.

## üìù UMB Command
The command "Update Memory Bank" or "UMB" can be given at any time to update the memory bank with information from the current chat session.
